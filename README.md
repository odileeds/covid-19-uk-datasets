## Notes

Case data:

### England

England data is easy to work with.
Link from dashboard - this may go away.
Column headers have spaces, so less easy to work with as properties.
Data is published as a daily count (not cumulative)

### Scotland

CSV is in a github repo, so more easily searchable.
...but the per-NHS Board data is in a wide table (row per date, column per board) => Not as easy to machine process.
